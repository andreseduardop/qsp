## Summary

Here’s the expanded and refined English definition including that concept:

**Quick Smart Plan** is an AI-powered web application designed to help you plan, organize, and manage projects, events, and any type of activity with speed and clarity. It’s also a **live demonstration of how local, in-browser AI** can dynamically generate pages that adapt to the user’s specific goals in real time. Here, AI moves beyond being just a text generator — it becomes a **user interface generator**, capable of shaping interactive layouts, components, and workflows on demand. Whether you’re organizing a personal event, coordinating a professional project, or exploring new ideas, Quick Smart Plan offers an adaptive, intelligent workspace that responds to your intent and helps you stay focused, creative, and efficient.
