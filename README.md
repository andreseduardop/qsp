# Quick Smart Plan

**Quick Smart Plan** is an AI-powered web application designed to help you plan, organize, and manage projects, events, or any type of activity quickly and clearly.

It also serves as a **live demonstration of how in-browser, local AI** can dynamically generate pages that adapt to a user’s goals in real time. Here, AI goes beyond being a text generator — it becomes a **user interface generator**, capable of creating interactive layouts, components, and workflows on demand.

Whether you’re organizing a personal event, coordinating a professional project, or exploring new ideas, Quick Smart Plan offers an adaptive, intelligent workspace that responds to your intent and helps you stay focused, creative, and efficient.

## Key Features

* **AI-Powered Layout Composition:**

* **Dynamic Interface Generation:**  
  Achieved through modular **VanillaJS** components that render adaptable sections such as task lists, step lists, and timelines.
